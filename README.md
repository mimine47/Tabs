Tabs Project
This is a simple tabs project that demonstrates how to create a tab navigation system using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each tab corresponds to a specific content section, which is shown or hidden when a tab is clicked.

Features
Interactive Tabs: Click on a tab to view the associated content.
CSS Styling: Simple and responsive design for tabs and content.
JavaScript Functionality: Uses JavaScript to manage the active tab and its content.
Project Structure
index.html: The main HTML file that defines the structure of the tabs and content.
tabs.css: The CSS file that styles the tabs, content, and page layout.
fun.js: The JavaScript file that implements the tab functionality.
How It Works
HTML Structure:

The tabs are defined within the div.tabs container.
Each tab has a data-tab attribute to link it with its corresponding content.
The content for each tab is placed inside .tab-content containers, also with matching data-tab attributes.
CSS Styling:

Tabs are styled to appear clickable with borders and padding.
Active tabs are highlighted with a background color and bold text.
Only the content corresponding to the active tab is displayed.
JavaScript Functionality:

When a tab is clicked, the active class is toggled on both the tab and the content.
JavaScript listens for clicks on each tab and updates the active content accordingly.
